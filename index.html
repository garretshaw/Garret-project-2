  <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The pamphlet “Stop Police Brutality”, written in 1952, is a document  to show oppression faced by African Americans in the United States, particularly in New Jersey. This is a detailed account of the brutality African Americans faced at the hands of law enforcement and a strategic tool to mobilize public opinion and a call for action to legislative government.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">     
<h2>Truth About Police Brutality</h2>
<p>The main idea of the document is to show how police brutality was a huge issue that affected African Americans. The pamphlet starts with a by addressing New Jersey. The writers brought to the government, was to raise awareness of basic rights for African Americans.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
<h2>What Is Police Brutality?</h2>
<p>Police brutality is the abuse of power by law enforcement, which could either be in the form of physical abuse, death, and lack of rights. By highlighting specific cases of African Americans who were victims of police violence, the pamphlet provides examples that help to define police brutality. The pamphlet helps show the unfair treatment of African Americans within the criminal justice system, in the form of false arrests, unlawful investigations, and not holding law enforcement accountable.</p>
</div>
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
 
     <p>In one example, the document shows the case of Daniel Meadows, a 14-year-old boy who was found dead in a police cell after being arrested on a minor charge. The police report claimed his death was a suicide,however no action was taken to investigate it any further. Another example is James Kennedy, who was a veteran shot in the back of the head by police and again no further action was taken. These examples illustrate police brutality which has even resulted in death..</p>
</div>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The issue is shown in a  number of ways in the pamphlet, showing widespread violence police and the unfair justice system. The “Bill of Particulars” section lists numerous scenarios of police brutality. What makes these cases have a powerful tone is not only the violence but what followed after with no accountability being taken. 

For exsample, the case of James Harmon, a 30-year-old African American who was brutally beaten by police in 1948 and later was held in police custody where he unfortunately passed away. The document also states that the police falsified the death certificate so that no later investigation would take place. The pattern of brutality and lack of accountability demonstrates the  consistent prejudice in law enforcement. 
Call For Action
The petition calls the Governor of New Jersey and the state legislature for a hearing about the issues addressed in the pamphlet. The pamphlet also calls to action legal changes that could help the issue get solved.

The pamphlet asks citizens to protest and come together with their community. The pamphlet asks citizens to write letters to their local government to ask for open hearing on police brutality. 
The pamphlet also asks the citizens to distribute the pamphlets to spread awareness. 
Conclusion: The Legacy of the Pamphlet and Its Relevance Today
The "Stop Police Brutality" pamphlet of 1952 was an important document in history to bring awareness to the unfair treatment by the justice system to African Americans. It provides examples of racial violence and is a call to action towards the justice system. The systemic nature of harm, as shown in the pamphlet, makes it clear that this issue appeared throughout the United States.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Other Exsamples</h2>
<p>In a more recent article “The Politics of Source” by Regina G Lawrence the reader can see a more recent example of this issue. The author states “ On July 5, 2016, police in Baton Rouge shot and killed Alton Sterling at point blank range. ALthough the pamphlet is old in this example it is clear that this issue has not disappeared. According to the University of Illinois Chicago more than 600 people each year are killed by law enforcement and over 250,000 are injured each year which show that the issue is still present. In the last image attached which is from “Police brutality and racism in America” Stephen A. Schwartz the reader can interpret that race still may be a factor in law enforcement.
